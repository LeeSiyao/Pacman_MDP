This code is to use MDP theory to control pacman to win as much as possible in the game under python. 
Much more details are described in the report which is attached inside.
MDP is a classical planning algorithm which is widely used to make decision for the agent. 
This report is divided into two parts. 
The first part introduced the background of Markov decision process, then described my train of thought to write the code, 
which helps me to solve the Pacman problem under the strategy of MDP. 
The second part shows resulting performance of my code 
and made hypothesis about the relationship between value of ghosts and the performance of Pacman. 
At the end, I designed experiment to prove my hypothesis, and the results show that the value of ghost is inversely proportional to the rate to win the Pacman game.
